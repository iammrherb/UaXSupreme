# 802.1X Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the recommended phases for deploying 802.1X authentication on your network.

## Phase 1: Planning and Preparation

**Documentation and Inventory:**
- Document your existing network topology
- Inventory all network devices (switches, access points)
- Inventory all endpoints that will connect to the network
- Identify devices that can't support 802.1X

**Identity Store Preparation:**
- Set up or integrate with existing identity stores (Active Directory, LDAP)
- Plan user groups and permissions
- Create test accounts for each user type

**RADIUS Server Setup:**
- Install and configure RADIUS server (ISE, NPS, Clearpass)
- Configure high availability
- Set up integration with identity stores
- Create basic authentication policies

## Phase 2: Pilot Deployment

**Initial Configuration:**
- Configure a small set of switches (1-2) for testing
- Start with monitor mode (open authentication)
- Configure for both 802.1X and MAB
- Set up logging and monitoring

**Test with Known Devices:**
- Test authentication with various device types
- Document successful and failed authentications
- Adjust policies as needed
- Test failover scenarios

**Limited User Testing:**
- Expand to a small group of cooperative users
- Provide clear instructions and support
- Gather feedback and troubleshoot issues
- Document common problems and solutions

## Phase 3: Limited Production Deployment

**Expand Deployment:**
- Configure additional switches in monitor mode
- Implement learned best practices
- Refine authentication policies
- Develop troubleshooting processes

**Enhanced Monitoring:**
- Set up enhanced monitoring and alerts
- Define authentication success metrics
- Develop reporting on authentication activity
- Create dashboards for operational visibility

**User Communication:**
- Communicate with broader user base
- Provide documentation and self-help resources
- Ensure help desk is prepared for support calls
- Set expectations for full deployment

## Phase 4: Full Deployment

**Switch to Closed Mode:**
- Gradually convert monitor mode to closed mode
- Start with lower-impact areas
- Schedule changes during maintenance windows
- Have rollback procedures ready

**Full Network Coverage:**
- Expand to all network access points
- Implement consistent policy across the network
- Maintain regular monitoring and reporting
- Document final configuration

**Operational Procedures:**
- Establish routine maintenance procedures
- Create onboarding processes for new devices
- Document exception handling
- Develop regular review and audit processes

## Phase 5: Optimization

**Policy Refinement:**
- Refine authorization policies based on real-world usage
- Implement more granular access controls
- Consider integrating with posture assessment
- Add profiling for device-type-based policies

**Performance Tuning:**
- Optimize timeout and retry settings
- Fine-tune RADIUS server performance
- Implement load balancing if needed
- Review and adjust monitoring thresholds

**Security Enhancements:**
- Implement additional security controls
- Consider adding MACsec for wired encryption
- Integrate with security incident monitoring
- Regularly audit authentication logs

## Appendix: Common Issues and Solutions

**Authentication Failures:**
- Verify RADIUS server connectivity
- Check server certificates for EAP-TLS/PEAP
- Ensure correct shared secrets are configured
- Verify user credentials in identity store

**MAB Issues:**
- Ensure MAC addresses are in correct format
- Verify MAC address is in the database
- Check MAB is enabled on the port
- Confirm authorization policy for MAB

**Client Supplicant Issues:**
- Verify supplicant configuration
- Check EAP method compatibility
- Update supplicant software if needed
- Validate certificate trust (for PEAP/EAP-TLS)
